# c291 final project NeRF implementaion

Implements a NeRF inspired by the original [NeRF](https://github.com/bmild/nerf) and its faithful PyTorch implementation [NeRF-pytorch](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch).

# usage
If running in a linux VM or a remote computer with linux, run
```bash
bash ./setup/set_up.sh
```
then simply run `python main.py --config ./configs/<EXPERIMENT NAME>` or modify `run.sh`.

Additionally, if you want to instantly run the code with default configs in `configs`, copy-paste the contents of `clone_and_run.sh` into your terminal.
